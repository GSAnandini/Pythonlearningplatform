<h2>About python</h2>
<p><b>* </b>Python is a high-level programming language.</p>
<p><b>* </b>It was invented by Guido-Van-Rossum and released in 2001.</p>
<p><b>* </b>It is both procedural and object oriented.</p>
<p><b>* </b>Python uses interpreter which converts the code written in python language by the user to the language which computer hardware or system can understand.</p>
<h2>Keywords</h2>
<p>Python has a set of keywords that are reserved words that cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers</p>
<p>There total <b>33</b> keywords in python.</p>
<h2>Identifiers</h2>
<p>"Identifiers" or "symbols" are the names you supply for variables, types, functions, and labels in your program.</p>
<h3>Rules of Identifiers</h3>
<p><b>* </b>Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore _ .</p>
<p><b>* </b>An identifier cannot start with a digit.</p>
<p><b>* </b>Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.</p>
<p><b>* </b>We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. </p>
<p><b>* </b>An identifier can be of any length.</p>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>A comment is a piece of code that isnâ€™t executed by the compiler or interpreter when the program is executed.</p>
<h3>Single Line Comment:</h3>
<p><b>*</b> Single line comments are those comments which are written without giving a line break or newline in python. </p>
<p><b>*</b> we use <b>#</b> to write single line comment in python.</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p><b>#</b><b> This is a single Line comment</b></p>
<h3>Multiple Line Comment:</h3>
<p><b>*</b> Multiple line comments are those comments which are written by giving a line break or newline in python. </p>
<p><b>*</b> we use <b>'''...comment...'''</b> to write single line comment in python.</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p><b>'''This is </b></p>
<p><b>a</b></p> 
<p><b>multiline comment in python</b></p>
<p><b>which expands to many lines'''</b></p>
