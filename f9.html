<h2>Tuples</h2>
<p>Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

<p>Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

<p>A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

<p>Tuples are written with round brackets.

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a Tuple:

<p>thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
<p>print(thistuple)
<h3>Output:</h3>
<p>('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
<h3>Access Tuple Items</h3>
<p>You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets:

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Print the second item in the tuple:

<p>thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
<p>print(thistuple[1])
<h3>Output:</h3>
<p>banana
<p>Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.
